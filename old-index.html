            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>Sieged Kingdoms is a Geopolitical-MMORPG server where you can build your ideal nation from the ground up,
                start your dream business, become a performer and tour the land, or be a nomad living a life of
                lawlessness. The goal is not to destroy nations but to spread power and influence socially,
                economically, politically, or militarily.</p>

            <p>It is important to note that this is NOT a factions server. Towns, Cities, and Nations will be referred
                to as <u>“States”</u> for the sake of simplicity in this document.</p>
            <p>Read everything carefully; you may be
                questioned about the contents. Refer to this document when engaging politically or starting a Town,
                business, crime, battle, or other applicable matters—contact moderators with any questions.
            </p>
            <p>Please take care when making your MCA character. Once it is confirmed it is <u>final</u> and can
                <u>not</u> be
                changed.

        <section id="diplomacy">
            <h2>Diplomacy</h2>
            <p>In the geopolitical landscape, it's always hard to get your way or please everyone; everything you do
                could cause one or more States to like or dislike you. Being a Head of State is never easy; peace
                doesn't last forever. But here we have some ideas to help the peace last that bit longer. The tap can
                only drip for so long—sooner or later, it will burst, and all-out total war will spread across the land.
            </p>
            <p>When creating a Town, you must declare its existence in the <a
                    href="https://discord.com/channels/1082709104373551216/1121533624592896080">International updates
                    forum</a> and the
                <a href="https://discord.com/channels/1082709104373551216/1108134711672451183">International board
                    channel</a>. Nomad groups are <u>not</u> required to do this, but more on them later. We urge
                players to form Towns near other Towns to aid in the geopolitical roleplay. This is a geopolitics server
                but no one will raid you and destroy your whole Town. We all need to work together somewhat.
            </p>
            <p>States are to go through diplomatic measures when relations decrease and tensions rise. It's best to call
                for an international court session. During an International Court, all heads of state will attend and
                attempt to discuss a peaceful resolution that best suits everyone. War can be called at any point during
                the international court or in the international board chat if you feel it is necessary. However, hastily
                calling for war will make your State look bad to the other global powers, and sanctions may be placed on
                your State and citizens.</p>
            <p>Diplomatic measures you can take to improve relations include but aren't limited to:</p>
            <div class="center">
                <ul>
                    <li>Opening trade</li>

            <p>Sieged Kingdoms uses a progression-based system for State building. Each stage has requirements that need
                to be fulfilled. Land Claims are to be marked out using the Map Frontier. If you want to create a
                nation, here are the steps you must take. You must not claim whole seas and oceans You can only start
                using Create and other Tech Mods once you have achieved Village Status. Moderators may change up your
                borders to look more natural for the sake of style purpose , this is to avoid states having square
                shapes. Please try to make your borders realistic following river lines, mountains, biomes, Only claim
                what you will intend to actually use.

            <p>Next is forming the Nation, to form a nation you must have 2 cities constructed. One of these cities is
                to be named the capital city and must include a National Treasury, Parliament Buildings and National
                Monument. And enough housing for your current member count x3 (10 members = 30 homes)</p>
            <p>The requirements listed are just the minimum, and obviously,
                You can add more and style your state as much as you like with additional areas such as parks, religious
                buildings, festival areas, etc.
                Towns cannot declare war but can be invaded; if attacked, they can defend. Only Cities and Nations can
                wage war and form unions. However, Towns may join alliances if invited into one.
            </p>
            <p>Buildings must have some effort and style put into them, purposefully creating low effort towns will
                cause your state deemed incomplete and you will be removed from the international sphere until you do
                what is needed.</p>
            <p>If a Town or City is very far away from the rest of the general population of the server, they can call
                upon the international court for nationhood. The court will vote on whether they see the Town City as an
                independent nation. If the court grants nation status, your City/Town will be internationally recognized
                as a nation. If they deny your nation status, you won't officially be internationally recognized, but
                other countries may identify you as an independent nation.</p>
            <p>If your City is a part of a nation and you feel you are being mistreated, you could do one of two things:
                The first and most diplomatic option is an independence movement, demanding independence through
                protest. Referendums and get people to join the cause through propaganda campaigns.
            </p>
            <p>States can be constructed in the Overworld and Nether, Constructing States in the End is forbidden and
                will result in it being removed as it breaks the server Dynamic. We advise for players to stick to the
                Overworld just for the sake of convenience.</p>

        <section id="cit-ind-bus">
            <h2>Citizenship, Industry, & Business</h2>
            <p>Not everyone wants to rule a nation; some just want to become citizens and live in Cities or Towns. As a
                citizen, you can take on many roles: Worker, Entrepreneur, Soldier, Scientist, Doctor, Mechanic,
                Engineer, Builder, Politician, and Performer, just to name a few. Realistically, the list is endless!
                These roles are mostly here for the sake of roleplay. But some serve purposes that benefit the nation,
                such as Builders, Military personnel, Scientists, and Engineers.</p>
            <p>Citizens and Businesses are to follow the laws of the government they are inside of, even if that means
                taxation or drafts. When captured/arrested, the use of /back, /spawn, or /home is disallowed, and if you
                are found to do this, you receive a 3-day ban. Prisons are to be escapable, and prisoners must set their
                spawn in the prison cell and enter the cell with no items.</p>
            <h3>Starting a Business</h3>
            <p>If you wish to start a business, talk to the head of your state about opening a shop. Once you have a
                shop, you can use Lightman's currency to allow people to purchase items you are selling.</p>
            <h3>Becoming a Star</h3>
            <p>If performing arts is your thing, we have two music mods you may enjoy: Etched and Xcera Music! Using
                Xcera, you can create your own music using MIDI or upload custom music onto discs using Etched! You can
                then sell your creations and travel worldwide to different states, sharing your art!</p>
            <h3>Broadcastic Opportunities</h3>
            <p>Citizens can create news networks to share news and updates in their nation. Talk to Chisasfam for more
                information on shows.</p>
            <h3>Industry and Business</h3>
            <p>A State’s industry must match the State’s size. Large Towns/Cities can have small industries or no
                industry if they are trade-reliant, but they must make it clear they rely on trade for their resources.
                A guide to industry standards can be found below.</p>
            <p>Small Industry = Small Town, minimal housing, minor transport.
                Medium Industry = Medium Town, balanced housing, marketplace, basic transport network.
                Large industry = Large Town, plentiful housing, sizeable economic district, advanced transport network.
            </p>
            <p>Businesses and industries must be located inside a Town’s/City’s border. Regardless of the
                Business/Industry type, even if it is an international company, it must have an HQ inside a Town/City.
                If it is an industrial company, its industry must also be inside a State. The industrial area and HQ
                don't have to be inside the same Town/City.</p>

        <section id="nom-ter-org-cri">
            <h2>Nomads, Terrorism, & Organized Crime</h2>
            <h3>Nomads</h3>
            <p>Nomads follow a slightly different rule set to the regular player base. Nomad groups are small bands of
                at most four people. Two nomad groups can combine to form a “tribe,” bringing the total to an
                eight-player maximum. If there are any more members, they will be considered a nation and must follow
                the standard guidelines.
            </p>
            <p>These individuals are <u>STRICTLY FORBIDDEN</u> from industrializing (No Create, automatic farms,
                Villager Farms). Nomads cannot start a Minecolony or Town. Nomads must not be aligned to any State,
                alliance, or company. However, they can trade with States to obtain more advanced items.</p>
            <p>Nomad groups must declare attacks on the international board before they happen; both parties must be
                online for an attack to commence.</p>
            <h3 id="terrorism">Terrorism</h3>
            <p>Terrorism is one of the many ways you can scare your enemy into complying with you. However, keep in mind
                that attacking another State via Terrorism will put you in a bad standing geopolitically and may have
                sanctions placed on your Town/City. Associating with Terrorists/Terrorist groups will do the same.
                “Creeper Wine” is not to be used in terrorism. The following buildings can be terrorized:
                Embassies, Town Halls, Parliament, City Halls, Treasury, Mint, Airports, Train Stations,
                Stadiums/Arenas, Memorial Statues, Memorial Parks, Churches, Farms, Factories, Prisons, Labs, Power
                Plants, and Saloons.
            </p>
            <p>The following buildings cannot be terrorized:
                Shops, Clubs, Bars, Cafes, Restaurants, Housing, and Schools.
                We put these restrictions on terrorism because the point of committing terrorist acts isn't to
                mindlessly grief. It is to scare the other State into conforming to your demands or spreading
                political/religious power. You need a purpose to terrorize. Remember, this isn't a factions server. It
                is geopolitics. Terrorist attacks need to be declared as soon as they happen. Terrorists can force or
                ask nations or other groups to take responsibility for the attack.
            </p>
            <h4><u>If a State is at war, you are not to commit an act of terror against them.</u></h4>
            <h3>Terrorism and Events</h3>
            <p>States can host Community Events, Arcade Events, and Political events.
                Everyone can attend community events. These are things like Music Festivals, Concerts, and Grand
                openings. These CANNOT be terrorized (Unless they are located in a political building).
            </p>
            <p>Political events can be invite-only or public. These CAN be terrorized regardless of their location.
                Political events include the Olympics/competitive games, Military Parades, Political debates, elections,
                Culture Festivals, speeches (spawn is exempt from this ruling), and assassinations can happen in
                Political Events.
            </p>
            <p>Everyone can play at arcade events. These cannot be terrorized as they are essentially mini-games.
            </p>
            <p>When hosting an event, you must CLEARLY state if it is a COMMUNITY EVENT or a POLITICAL EVENT. Any event
                that is competitive and will have a winner(s) is a political event. (Apart from canned)
            </p>
            <p>
                If you are assassinated, you will be temp-banned for two hours. During these two hours, you are to be
                perceived as Dead. You are disallowed from declaring war, making political decisions, or engaging with
                the Sieged Kingdoms Discord Server (apart from Server Booster and Donor channels) until you are
                unbanned. This ban will not go on any ban record the moderation team has, as it’s RP-related. Your
                government is to take over in your place until you return. Only ONE assassination is allowed per event.
                Remember, the aim of terrorism is not to mindlessly grief. But to be a show of power and an attempt to
                force a State into compliance. You can damage the building or hold a mass shooting, but the complete
                destruction of buildings is disallowed.
            </p>
            <h3>Organized Crime</h3>
            <p>Organized Crime can take five forms on the server. Yakuza, Mafia, Cartel, Street gangs, and Banditry.
            </p>
            <p>Yakuza families are highly sophisticated and very feared. They are often aiding the government in
                lowering the crime rate and improving the economy with various under-the-table dealings. Yakuza Families
                tend to value discipline and respect and won't be afraid to turn you in or kill you off if you aren't
                pulling your weight. Yakuza activity often includes, but is not limited to, gambling, killer for hire,
                real estate, loan sharks, drugs, and arms dealing.
            </p>
            <p>Mafia Families are classy and know how to get a job done. They have a code of honor, and breaking that
                will end up with you in a hole somewhere. Towns with Mafia tend to have a higher crime rate than nations
                with Yakuza. Mafia activities often include, but aren't limited to, drugs, gambling, killer for hire,
                and arms dealing.
            </p>
            <p>Cartel families are ruthless and lawless people, going after civilians and Law enforcement constantly.
                They kill to get their way and ensure people know not to mess with them, Unlike Mafia and Yakuza, which
                are more sophisticated and have a hierarchy. Cartels tend to be less strict, having one leader and
                subgroups all working for that one leader. Each sub-group may have one or two leaders to help keep some
                structure. Cartel activities often include but are not limited to drugs and killer hire.
            </p>
            <p>Street Gangs are Low-level thugs looking to get a foothold in the crime business. Their work needs to be
                more organized. Street gang activities often include but are not limited to drugs, killer for hire, and
                vandalism.
            </p>
            <p>Bandit groups are based inside one Town and travel to others, thieving from banks or the citizens,
                pulling train or boat heists, and engaging in street duels. They bring the loot back to their hometown
                for the citizens to use. Heisting of Banks and Trains is allowed at any time as long as members of that
                Town are online, but theft of personal property (homes) is disallowed. Breaking this rule will result in
                a 3-day ban. Bandit activities often include but are not limited to street duels, shootings, and heists.
            </p>
            <p>Organized crime families can engage in Business and politics and aid the government in support or revolt.
                (citizens of States can also revolt against the leader if they wish). Organized crime families must be
                aligned to a Town/City and have active residency in said Town/City, basing all their operations in that
                location. Crime families can have their own political ecosystem, establishing trade and forming
                alliances with other families worldwide. They may also engage in “under-the-table dealings” with the
                military, government, and law enforcement.
                Street duels between rival gangs, families, or individuals can happen in Towns unannounced but must not
                damage infrastructure or buildings. Too many fights may harm international relations.
            </p>
            <p>Yakuza, Mafia, and Cartel-run businesses can engage in Business Battles to win a foothold in the nation's
                economy and eliminate any competition in the State their business is in. Explosions, shootings, and
                traps must not affect companies not involved in the battle. If they do, the perpetrator will repay all
                damages to the business affected. If a Town or City has too many business battles within its border, the
                area may deem the nation unsafe, and diplomatic relations may worsen. International business battles can
                also be done, which may sour diplomatic relations.
                Business battles don't need to be announced on the global board and can happen anytime. Both business
                owners need to be online, and a reason is necessary for a business battle. The reasons for business
                battles are crippling competitor businesses, businesses being run by an opposing crime family, and the
                desire to have that plot of land.
                Businesses can be stolen from during business battles. Organized crime families can loot other organized
                crime families as long as both families are online.

        <section id="the-art-of-war">
            <h2>The Art of War</h2>
            <p>War can be declared if peace cannot be negotiated or the situation is severe enough. A head-of-state or
                State Representative will declare war in the international board chat. Use this message layout when
                declaring war:
                “[State name] is declaring war on @[State name]’
                It is crucial to ping them so they are aware. You will then be given the conflict role and able to see a
                hidden channel called “Combat Marshal.” You and the nation you have declared war on are forbidden to
                commit any acts of war or engage in any aggressions until the Combat Marshal states the battles can
                begin.
                You will be given two playstyle options: Arcade and Simulator. Explanations and other information are
                provided below and will be provided by the Combat Marshal on the day of the battles.
            </p>
            <h3>Arcade</h3>
            <p>Arcade Wars are a series of combats that take a “Turf Wars” style of play. Each match will determine
                where the next is fought. The more Towns and Cities you have, the longer the war will last, following
                the below format.</p>
            <p>Battle 1: Wilderness Skirmish or Border Clash. Both sides engage in combat in an area between the two
                nations.</p>
            <p>Battle 2: First Offensive, Losers of the first battle will have to defend one of their Towns from the
                invaders (Winners of the first battle).
            </p>
            <p>Battle 3: If the Defenders win, a counteroffensive will take place. The Attackers will move on to the
                next Town/City if they win. If there is only one Town, they must capture the town hall in battle 4).
            </p>
            <p>Battle 4: If the counteroffensive is successful, they will move on to the next area; if the counterattack
                fails, the next battle will be another Wilderness Skirmish/Border Clash, and the cycle will start again.
            </p>
            <p>1 hour before the confrontation is set to begin, both teams are to go to the location and set up. No
                killing or war acts will happen in this hour. The assigned combat marshal will announce when you can
                start. If you feel foul play is involved in the battle, state that you want to time out, and the combat
                marshal will review. The combat marshal will be recording, and we advise all participants to record
                their POV to get a clear view of what is happening. In Arcade, Each player has 5 lives.</p>
            <h3>Simulator</h3>
            <p>In Simulator Mode, the combat marshal will state when the conflict can commence. Simulator battles have
                no set time, life count, or location. As long as members of both sides are online, it is combat time.
                There are no pre-set win conditions, and the fighting can be constant. The war ends when one side
                surrenders, wishes to negotiate terms, or if the Capital becomes occupied by the enemy. This playstyle
                is more realistic, so securing locations and capturing areas to gain advantages is vital. You may want
                to try to gain leverage over your enemy by targeting military, industrial, and political areas.
                Attacking residential and commercial districts is permitted; however, politically speaking, doing so
                will put you in bad standing. Recording your POV in case of foul play is recommended, as Combat Marshals
                do not monitor Simulator Battles.
            </p>
            <h3>Additional Information</h3>
            <p>When attacking another State, your spawn point cannot be set inside of the State’s borders unless it is a
                captured area. Attackers' spawn point must be a MINIMUM of 100 blocks away from the defending State’s
                border unless they are a neighboring State. In that case, keep your spawn within your borders but at
                least 50 blocks from the enemy border.
            </p>
            <p>The complete destruction of States is disallowed. Remember, this is geopolitics, not factions. We advise
                you to look at every peaceful resolution before choosing the path of war. The goals of war can be to
                throw a head of state out of power, annex land, liberate land, and spread a political or religious
                ideology. Going to war with a nation because you are bored is disallowed.
            </p>
            <p>Once you choose your playstyle, it cannot be changed. Both sides must agree on a playstyle; if they
                can't, the conflict will default to Arcade Battle.
                In simulator battles, the attacking and defending nations must be online for the fighting to commence.
                If a country is online and allied with the defending government but the nation you want to attack is not
                online, you are NOT to attack or enter the allied nation/captured area until the opposition comes
                online. Ceasefires can be called in at any time for whatever reason but they don’t always have to be
                accepted.
            </p>
            <p>Nomads and Tribes have to follow these guidelines when engaging with other Nomads and Tribes. However,
                when engaging with States, Combat Marshals may make special arrangements.
            </p>
            <p><u>The use of /back /home and /rtp are banned in battles
                    Pearl stasis chambers and Pearling behind enemy lines are also bannable offenses
                </u></p>
            <h3 id="microaggression">Microaggressions</h3>
            <p>When tensions rise, you may want to flaunt your weaponry and strength to deter the enemy from attacking
                or get them to comply. There are many ways you can go about this.
            </p>
            <p>Propaganda campaigns are an excellent way to get other nations or citizens to agree with your mission and
                conform to what you want. You could spread anti-propaganda about the opposing power to decrease their
                political standing, but doing so could also harm your reputation.
            </p>
            <p>Military parades are a great show of strength and an opportunity to display your weapons to the
                opposition. However, too many military parades will make your nation appear war-hungry and unstable,
                lowering political reputation. </p>
            <p>Military outposts will show the opposing State that your threats are no laughing matter and you do not
                plan to back down if tensions continue to rise. Outposts can be at a State border but cannot be used as
                a spawn point in conflicts.
            </p>
            <p> Militarizing borders is an aggressive form of microaggression and could be seen as an act of war by some
                States and result in total war. Reinforced borders can be used to show your power or encourage
                compliance with your demands. However, this behavior could give your state a bad reputation.
            </p>
            <h3>Resolutions</h3>
            <p>During wars, international meetings can be held to seek a resolution. At any moment, any side of the
                conflict can call for an international court to negotiate some terms to try to end the war once a
                solution is agreed upon. It’ll go into effect immediately. All fighting is to be ceased, and the
                State(s) can make the correct arrangements. If these post-war agreements are not met after one week, an
                international court can be held.</p>
            <h3>War Crimes</h3>
            <p>The Moderation Team does not dole out war crime punishments but rather the international board. Penalties
                include sanctions, restricted trade, closing all transport to and from a nation, removal from the
                International Economy, and arrest warrants. The list of war crimes can be found below.
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Killing an unarmed soldier or civilian</li>
                <li>Attacking Civilian, Religious, or Medical infrastructure</li>
                <li>Attacking memorials</li>
                <li>Torturing POWs to gain information</li>
                <li>Harassment of disadvantaged populations</li>
                <li>Targeting events of religious importance</li>
